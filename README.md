**Original App Design Project - README Template**

**Recipe Organizer**

**Overview**

***Description***
User can see some good default recipes, and also add new recipes for dishes that they want to replicate in the future.

**App Evaluation**
- Category: Organizer.
- Mobile: Mobile is essential for the instant checking of recipes for iOS users. People can use the app to look for interesting ideas with dishes.
- Story: Creates an app for people to learn how to cook and make great food. Allows people to create new dishes, and save them so that they can look over later on.
- Market: Any people can use this app, but it is focused more on people who spend time at home cooking.
- Habit: People would open this app if they are stuck on cooking food or if they want to record a new recipe.
- Scope: The app is relatively easy to build with the existing tools. The product needs to have some core features such as viewing recipes/adding new recipes/etc.
