**Step 1**: Generate new ideas
1. Fitness tracker
    - User can use this app to track the number of steps, calories burnt, calories intake from food, etc.
3. Recipe Organizer
    - User can see some good default recipes, and also add new recipes for dishes that they want to replicate in the future.
5. Travel Planner
    - User can use this app to check for iternaries, travel plans, dates, sites, etc.

**Step 2**: Evaluating ideas app
**Step 2.1**: I would like to focus more on the recipe organizer or travel planner.
**Step 2.2**: Evaluation
1. Recipe Organizer
- Mobile: Mobile is essential for the instant checking of recipes for iOS users. People can use the app to look for interesting ideas with dishes.
- Story: Creates an app for people to learn how to cook and make great food. Allows people to create new dishes, and save them so that they can look over later on.
- Market: Any people can use this app, but it is focused more on people who spend time at home cooking.
- Habit: People would open this app if they are stuck on cooking food or if they want to record a new recipe.
- Scope: The app is relatively easy to build with the existing tools. The product needs to have some core features such as viewing recipes/adding new recipes/etc.

2. Travel Planner
- Mobile: Mobile is essential for the instant checking of plans and events happening later in the trip. People can use the app to look for new activities and attractions in the area.
- Story: Creates an app for users to organize trips, and look for new activities. Allows people to organize itineraries and stuff that they want to bring to the trip.
- Market: Any people can use this app, but it is focused more on people who spend time at home cooking.
- Habit: People would open this app if they want to go on a trip and organize their stuff. But the frequency is low as not many people are going on trips in a year.
- Scope: The app is medium to hard to build with the existing tools. The product needs to have core features such as viewing ternaries, looking for new activities, etc.

Step 2.3: Final decision
I will build the recipe organizer app.
